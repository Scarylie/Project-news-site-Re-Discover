# Project-news-site-Re-Discover
Sprint 0: Pre-Course Technigo. Build a news website: 
Criteria: Style your page. Use CSS Grid and Flexbox. Use responsive design for dektop, tablet and mobile. The site should have a header, a main news article, a grid of news articles.

This project is my vision for my friend to share his study material with his followers. As for now he just emails his documents.

## The problem

I had problems figuring out how to use flex-box and grid and hos to tructure the code with different classes ans Divs. If i had more time i would like to have the news article boxes in squares and better pictures.
